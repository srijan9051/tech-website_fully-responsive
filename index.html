            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The IT industry mainly involves IT services, IT-enabled services (ITES),
                e-commerce (online business), and Software and Hardware products. This industry is also instrumental in
                developing infrastructure to store, process, and exchange information for necessary business operations
                and other organizations.
                The IT-BPM (Information technology and Business Process Management) sector of India has a share of 9.3% of the country's GDP, making it one of the biggest sectors to contribute to India's economic growth.
                Currently, IT services account for the lion's share of the market at 77.6%. The segment grew by 7.9% in 2021, compared with the 5.8% growth in 2020. IDC classifies the IT and business services market into three primary markets – project-oriented, managed services and support services.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Law enforcement and criminal justice authorities are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) and automated decision-making (ADM) systems. These systems are often used to profile people, ‘predict’ their actions, and assess their risk of certain behaviour, such as committing a crime, in the future. This can have devastating consequences for the people involved, who are profiled as criminals or considered a risk even though they haven’t actually committed a crime. Predictive policing is no longer confined to the realms of science fiction. These systems are being used by law enforcement around the world. And predictions, profiles</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The EU is in the process of regulating the use of AI through the AI Act but the proposed legislation does not go far enough. As more and more countries turn to AI and ADM in criminal justice, it is crucial that the EU becomes a leading standard-setter.The EU must ban the use of predictive, profiling and risk assessment AI and ADM systems in law enforcement and criminal justice. Strict safeguards must be introduced for all other uses.</p>
